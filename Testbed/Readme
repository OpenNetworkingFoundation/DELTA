This folder includes a prebuilt VM that was used to test the DELTA code, It'll make it easier to start from there instead of building  from scratch.
Issues faced while building this tesbed were mainly related to different versions of python, linux and lxc tools used. 
The testbed is built to use opendaylight as a controller, but you can change that as per DELTA guidelines and that should work fine too.
If you faced issues with this testbed let me know.
